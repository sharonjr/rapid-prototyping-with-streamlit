# M2 Lab 1

In this lab, we'll prepare the Avalanche data namely the Customer Reviews subset from an unstructured format to a structured format in Snowflake Notebooks.

## Setup

Follow the instructions provided in `setup.sql` to create a database, schema, stage as well as upload files for the Avalanche data.

## Using the data
Once this is completed, the Avalanche data can be accessed from the `@avalanche_db.avalanche_schema.customer_reviews;` stage directly.

For example, to list contents of the stage run this SQL query:
```sql
ls @avalanche_db.avalanche_schema.customer_reviews;
```

To read contents of a file:
```sql
-- Read single file
SELECT
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.PARSE_DOCUMENT(
    @avalanche_db.avalanche_schema.customer_reviews,
    'review-01.docx',
    {'mode': 'layout'}
  ) AS layout;
```

## Data Processing

Here, we're leveraging Snowflake Cortex to perform the following data processing tasks:
- `PARSE_DOCUMENT` function to extract text and data from unstructured DOCX files.
- `SENTIMENT` function to calculate the sentiment score of extracted customer review text
- `SUMMARIZE` function to return a concise summary of the customer review text
- `TRANSLATE:` function to translate given text from/to any supported language

## Data Visualization

Next, we'll use the structured data to create a bar chart to visualize the daily sentiment score and the product sentiment score.

## Running the Notebook

Download the Notebook in `IPYNB` format (`customer-reviews.ipynb`) and upload it to your Snowflake Snowsight account to run the Snowflake Notebook.
