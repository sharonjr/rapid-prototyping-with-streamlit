# M3 Lab 2 Setting up a RAG pipeline using Cortex Search

In Module 3 Lab 2, we're setting up the RAG pipeline using Cortex Search. We’ll build on the app and augmented prompt that we built in the previous lab, so make sure you complete that lab before attempting this one. 

## Running the Notebook

To follow along with the lab video:
1. From the Github Repo, browse to the folder M3/Lab2

3. In your Snowflake Snowsight account, from the left sidebar menu, select “Projects/Notebooks”
4. To the right of the bright blue “+Notebook” button on the top-right of your screen, click on the down arrow to bring up a drop-down menu
5. Select “Import .ipynb file”
6. Browse to the location where you downloaded the customer-reviews.ipynb file and click on “Open”
7. Give it a name, and then select the avalanche database, schema and stage that you created in Module Lab 1
